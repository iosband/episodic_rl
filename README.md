Episodic RL in Python
=====================

This is a framework to build up some very basic technology for episodic reinforcement learning written in Python.
Almost certainly, the goal is to migrate this functionality over to the existing package `rlpy` but right now I do not know how to do that.

To start, we will only consider episodes of fixed length H and no learning within an episode.
Trivially, this will include multi-armed bandits as a special case.
